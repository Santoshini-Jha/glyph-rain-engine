**glyph-rain-engine** is a minimalist visual engine that generates cascading streams of glowing green glyphs — an ode to classic cyberpunk aesthetics and the iconic digital rain effect.  
Built entirely with **HTML Canvas** and **vanilla JavaScript**, this engine runs instantly in any modern browser. No dependencies. No noise. Just pure glyph flow.

## 🌌 Concept

This project simulates a universe where characters fall like rain — glyphs drifting endlessly down the screen, fading into darkness, leaving brief neon afterimages behind.

The engine is a compact implementation that focuses on:
- 🎲 **Randomized glyph generation**
- 🟩 **Emerald glow effect**
- 🌀 **Smooth cascading trails**
- 📐 **Responsive scaling**
- ⚡ **Lightweight performance**
